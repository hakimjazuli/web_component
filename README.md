## @html_first/web_component

-   this library are made so you can made `native web component` easier with `jsdoc` and
    `type hinting`, which both are our main concern, therefore we don't have plan to produce any
    form of prebundled for client side minification;
-   we uses `native web component` naming semantics, so if you already familiar with
    `handmade native web component`, you can use that knowledge to develop this library or vice
    versa;
-   this library only provide bare minimum support to create `native web component`, and doesn't
    provide complex functionality such as `state management`;
    > -   we, however, have `signal based` >
    >     [sister library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@html_first/simple_signal) for
    >     `state management`
